* [Santander，LeasePlan测试Nivaura基于区块链的浮动利率债券（Santander, LeasePlan Testing Nivaura's Blockchain-Based Floating Rate Bond）](https://www.coindesk.com/santander-leaseplan-testing-nivauras-blockchain-based-floating-rate-bond?ref=tokendaily)

  资本市场创业公司Nivaura开发了它所谓的“第一个使用区块链技术的商业上可行的浮动利率债券”，这种新工具现在正在由银行业巨头桑坦德和租赁公司LeasePlan进行测试。

  Nivaura宣布，与纽约CoinDesk的2019年共识相吻合，其他从事浮动利率票据（FRN）的客户包括伦敦证券交易所集团（LSEG）和Premfina，后者是保险业的增长阶段优质融资服务提供商。

  Capital markets startup Nivaura has developed what it’s calling “the first commercially viable floating rate bond using blockchain technology,” and the new instrument is now being tested by banking giant Santander and LeasePlan, the vehicle leasing company

  Announced to coincide with CoinDesk’s Consensus 2019 in New York, Nivaura said other clients working on its floating rate notes (FRNs) include the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG) and Premfina, a growth-stage premium financing service provider in the insurance industry.

  星期一在纽约的区块链周开始，围绕着CoinDesk的2019年共识会议。我对当前情绪的看法？加密弹簧可能已经开始; 但对于企业中的区块链，它正在成为夏季。

  在这个月里，世界上一些领先的企业中出现了一系列活动 - 从伙伴关系和计划到试点和全面部署。

  特别是十项活动，展示了我们在五月份所看到的创新，我认为这个时期的优点是“区块链月”。

  Monday begins Blockchain Week in New York centered around CoinDesk’s Consensus 2019 conference. My takeaway on the current sentiment? The crypto spring may have begun; but for blockchain in the enterprise, it’s becoming summertime.

  Over the month, there has been a flurry of activity – from partnerships and plans to pilots and full-scale deployments – among some of the world’s leading enterprise.

  Ten events, in particular, demonstrate just how much innovation we’ve seen during May, a time I think merits the moniker the “Month of Blockchain.”

  块大小和大块还存在其他问题。一个问题是有些人希望通过卫星网络运行区块链，这在今天是可能的，但随着数据量的增加，这是不可能的。现在矿工需要集中对等，有些人想通过没收矿工来关闭比特币，这很难。从理论上讲，任何人都可以开采，没有人可以阻止世界各地的比特币采矿，但情况已经不再如此，因为如果有人知道矿工是谁，那么他们可能会被关闭。另一个问题是很多人都有带宽配额。目前在美国，最高级别是50 GB /月，许多人限制为5 GB /月。如果人们分享流量，那就不像人们不断地一直在大肆宣传。很多人都想实时看电影。如果比特币占用了所有带宽，那么他们就不会想要这样做。这是另一种可以运行完整节点的情况，但它们可能不会。

  There are other issues with block size and large blocks. One issue is that some people want to run the blockchain over the satellite networks, which is possible today but it would be impossible as data size increases. Right now miners would need centralized peering, and some people want to shutdown bitcoin by confiscating miners and that's hard. In theory, anyone can mine and nobody can stop bitcoin mining around the world, but that's no longer the case because if someone knows who the miners are then they can be shutdown. Another problem is that many people have bandwidth quotas. Right now in the US the highest level is 50 GB/month and many people are limited to 5 GB/month. If people are sharing traffic, it's not the same thing as people constantly maxxing out all the time. A lot of people want to watch movies in real-time. If bitcoin is taking all the bandwidth, then they won't want to do that. This is another case where they could run a full node, but they probably won't.
* [当控制成为了责任（Control as Liability）](https://vitalik.ca/general/2019/05/09/control_as_liability.html)

  在过去十年中，基于互联网的服务和应用程序的监管和法律环境发生了很大变化。当大规模社交网络平台在2000年代首次流行时，对大规模数据收集的一般态度基本上是“为什么不呢？”。这是马克扎克伯格的时代，说隐私时代已经结束，埃里克施密特争辩说，“如果你有一些你不想让任何人知道的东西，也许你不应该在第一时间这样做。”而且他们认为这是个人意识：你可以获得关于他人的每一点数据对你来说是一个潜在的机器学习优势，每一个限制都是一个弱点，如果这些数据发生了什么，那么成本相对较小。十年后，情况大不相同。

  The regulatory and legal environment around internet-based services and applications has changed considerably over the last decade. When large-scale social networking platforms first became popular in the 2000s, the general attitude toward mass data collection was essentially “why not?”. This was the age of Mark Zuckerberg saying the age of privacy is over and Eric Schmidt arguing, “If you have something that you don’t want anyone to know, maybe you shouldn’t be doing it in the first place.” And it made personal sense for them to argue this: every bit of data you can get about others was a potential machine learning advantage for you, every single restriction a weakness, and if something happened to that data, the costs were relatively minor. Ten years later, things are very different.

  在Web 2基础架构上设置自动节点故障转移解决方案非常容易。它有两个内容相同的节点。外部服务器监视主节点并检测是否存在问题。如果是这样，您网站的内部DNS会自动更新，以便将流量重定向到您的辅助节点。主节点再次运行后，流量将返回到主节点。

  An automated node failover solution is surprisingly easy to set up on a Web 2 infrastructure. It has two nodes with identical content. An external server monitors the primary node and detects if there is a problem. If so, your site’s internal DNS is automatically updated so that traffic will be redirected to your secondary node. Once your primary node is working again, traffic will be returned to your primary node.
