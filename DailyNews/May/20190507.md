* 【技术】[2600万TRX被盗背后的罗生门 - 第二集（Rashomon behind the 26 million TRX stolen - Episode II）](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzU1OTQ3MTI3Ng==&mid=2247484850&idx=1&sn=817d0c78e9a3129f2d02cb13ebd252b1&chksm=fc178a71cb600367965e76778db0df9e69980e79d4115cd1f6f3bf8ca6a30f636c13e0c29535&scene=0&xtrack=1)

  随着新一天的调查，更多证据被各方挖掘出来，本次事件的真相正在逐渐浮出水面，戏剧化程度堪比一场年度大戏。

  自从5月3日晚上9点wojak出现并贴出一份退款对比名单之后，再次从Discord消失，在此期间很多人开始给wojak打上Scammer（骗子）的标签，并认为“他不会退款，可能已经开上兰博基尼去度假了”，诸如此类言论不绝于耳。

  With a new day of investigation, more evidence has been unearthed, and the truth of the incident is gradually surfacing. It is as dramatic as an annual drama.
 
  Since Wojak appeared at 9 p.m. on May 3 and posted a list of refund comparisons, it disappeared from Discord again, during which time many people began labeling Wojak Scammer and believing that "he won't refund, maybe he's gone on a holiday in Lamborghini," and so on.
* 【技术】[Polkadot 的起源与进化：超越以太与 Cosmos 的治理与设计（Origin and Evolution of Polkadot: Governance and Design Beyond Ether and Cosmos）](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzU5MDU2MzIzOQ==&mid=2247487865&idx=2&sn=b157ccdd22bf409aeb937d3ab3b04039&chksm=fe3d03b1c94a8aa7049cfaf6362e20cca2b351faefb38b2ad1426590c147b8ad89c984984408&scene=0&xtrack=1)

  在诸多还未上线主网的区块链中，跨链项目 Polkadot 也成为了至今为止热度最高的区块链之一。但常常与 Cosmos、以太坊并肩出现的 Polkadot，在无数的对比中作为配角，不断地被割裂与被重构。
  
  作为 Gavin 实现 web 3.0 愿景的产物，Polkadot 是一种异构多链协议，旨在实现以往区块链努力实现的 3 个目标：互通性、可扩展性、共享安全。

  Among many block chains that have not yet been put on the main network, the cross-chain project Polkadot has also become one of the most popular block chains so far.However, Polkadot, often appearing side by side with Cosmos and ETF, acts as a supporting role in countless comparisons and is constantly split and reconstructed.

  As a product of Gavin's vision of web 3.0, Polkadot is a heterogeneous multi-chain protocol, aiming at achieving three goals of block chains: interoperability, scalability and shared security.
* 【技术】[SegWit版本1输出支出规则（ SegWit version 1 output spending rules）](https://github.com/sipa/bips/blob/bip-schnorr/bip-taproot.mediawiki?ref=tokendaily)

  之前提出了许多改进比特币脚本功能的相关想法：Schnorr签名（bip-schnorr），Merkle分支（“MAST”，BIP114，BIP117），新的sighash模式（BIP118），新的操作码如CHECKSIGFROMSTACK，Taproot，Graftroot，G'root和cross-input aggregation。

  将所有这些想法结合在一个提案中将是一个广泛的变化，难以审查，并可能错过在此过程中可能已经做出的新发现。其中一些想法也不如其他想法成熟。另一方面，将它们全部分成独立的提案会降低效率和隐私收益，并使其相互作用的分析复杂化。似乎最好只关注一个目标，并结合交互技术来实现它们。

  A number of related ideas for improving Bitcoin's scripting capabilities have been previously proposed: Schnorr signatures (bip-schnorr), Merkle branches ("MAST", BIP114, BIP117), new sighash modes (BIP118), new opcodes like CHECKSIGFROMSTACK, Taproot, Graftroot, G'root, and cross-input aggregation.

  Combining all these ideas in a single proposal would be an extensive change, be hard to review, and likely miss new discoveries that otherwise could have been made along the way. Some of these ideas are also less mature than others. On the other hand, separating them all into independent proposals would reduce the efficiency and privacy gains to be had, and complicate analysis of their interactions. It seems preferable to focus on one goal set at a time, and combine interacting technologies to achieve them.
* 【技术】[量化不变性（Quantifying Immutability）](https://medium.com/ethereum-classic/quantifying-immutability-e8f2b1bb9301)
 
  Ç urrently，存在着cryptocurrency社区在不变性的定义的辩论。目前，人们不能完全衡量不变性的各个方面，即强势与弱势的不变性，而只是某些东西是不可改变的。这成为一个问题，因为区块链试图升级允许未来功能的新功能，但正在努力遵循不可变性的原则。

  为了让我们能够更好地量化不变性，我们需要首先弄清楚我们可以在不变性与可变性问题上分配给子系统的实际分类。

  Currently, there exists a debate in cryptocurrency communities over the definition of immutability. One can currently not fully measure aspects of immutability as strong vs. weak immutability, but only whether something is immutable or not. This becomes an issue as blockchains try to upgrade new features that allow for future functionality but are wrestling with how that can follow the tenets of immutability.

  In order for us to come up with a better measure of quantifying immutability, we need to first figure out an actual measure of what classification we can assign to a subsystem on the question of immutability vs. mutability.
